### What is Data Structure/why it is important?
Computer is fast at solving numeric problems. But business application requires - complex data for the purpose. And apart from Computer no-one have any idea about binary number system. 

So, for redability and business requirements concerned structured data is there, which requires to be processed faster. 

So, here comes the Data Structure, which is to build different data for business purposes to solve specific problems. 

## New Algorithm addition rule
For any new algorithms (ranging from concurrency to encryption), mention why the algorithm should be added. What importance/contribution the algorithm will make for Computer Science field, keeping Industry and Academics in mind. 

For corner cases, we have extended [repository](). This library is aimed toweards Classic Data Structures keeping the repository concise.
